# Smart Student Attendance System using Facial Recognition

This project is a Python-based machine learning application for a smart student attendance system using facial recognition. The user interface is built using Tkinter, and a MySQL database is used for storing and retrieving all the information related to student attendance.

## Features
- Facial recognition technology to mark student attendance
- User-friendly interface developed with Tkinter
- MySQL database integration for efficient data management
- Automatic attendance tracking and reporting

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ishrutimishra/smart-student-attendance-system.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up the MySQL database and configure the connection in the `config.py` file.

## Usage
1. Run the `main.py` file to start the application.
2. Add student information to the database.
3. Use the facial recognition feature to mark student attendance.

## Configuration
In the `config.py` file, you can configure the following settings:
- MySQL database connection details
- Threshold for facial recognition accuracy
- Paths to the necessary files and directories
